Check the python file for solution to this problem:

You possess bitcoins in the form of UTXOs sorted by date and you need to send your friend X bitcoins. Find a date range whose outputs that will result in the least amount of change. Ideal solution will use Python whose function find_range(utxos, x) will give back the start and end dates. Each utxo has value and date (in unix time).
